# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on Custom Dataset

This repository provides the code and instructions for fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) such as GPT, BERT, or similar models on a custom dataset. The fine-tuning process aims to adapt the pre-trained LLM to better handle tasks specific to your dataset, including text generation, summarization, classification, or other NLP tasks.

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, BERT, and their variants have shown impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation tasks. Fine-tuning these models on specific datasets can significantly improve their performance for targeted applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.8.1 or higher
- Transformers library by Hugging Face
- CUDA (if using a GPU for training)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-finetune.git
    cd llm-finetune
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset

Prepare your custom dataset for fine-tuning. The dataset should be in a suitable format for the task, such as JSON, CSV, or text files. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory:

### For Text Generation or Summarization

```
data/
  train.json
  val.json
```

Ensure your JSON files follow this structure:

```json
[
  {"input": "Input text here", "target": "Expected output text here"},
  {"input": "Another input text", "target": "Another expected output"}
]
```

### For Text Classification

```
data/
  train.csv
  val.csv
```

Ensure your CSV files follow this structure:

```csv
text,label
"This is a sample text",0
"Another example text",1
...
```

## Fine-Tuning

To fine-tune the LLM on your dataset, execute the following command:

```bash
python fine_tune.py --train_file data/train.json --val_file data/val.json --model_name gpt2 --output_dir models/llm-finetuned
```

### Fine-Tuning Parameters

- `--train_file`: Path to the training dataset file.
- `--val_file`: Path to the validation dataset file.
- `--model_name`: Name or path of the pre-trained model to use (e.g., `gpt2`, `bert-base-uncased`).
- `--output_dir`: Directory where the fine-tuned model will be saved.

You can also customize other training parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs in the `fine_tune.py` script.

## Evaluation

After fine-tuning, evaluate the model to ensure it meets the desired performance metrics. Run the evaluation script as follows:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_dir models/llm-finetuned --test_file data/val.json
```

This script will generate performance metrics relevant to your task, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, BLEU score, etc.

## Results

The results of the fine-tuning process, including training and evaluation metrics, will be saved in the `results/` directory. Key metrics to consider are accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score for classification, and BLEU score for generation tasks.

## Usage

To use the fine-tuned LLM for inference, load it using the Transformers library:

### For Text Generation

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("models/llm-finetuned")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("models/llm-finetuned")

input_text = "Your input text here"
inputs = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=50)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(generated_text)
```

### For Text Classification

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
import torch

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("models/llm-finetuned")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("models/llm-finetuned")

input_text = "Your input text here"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
predicted_class = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).item()

print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}")
```
